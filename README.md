# User Behavior Analysis and Data Cleaning

This repository contains the analysis and data cleaning performed for a user behavior analysis project. The project focuses on understanding user engagement and how it correlates with virtual merchandise purchases and sponsorship 

## Project Contents:
Xtern_DA_&_Cleaning.ipynb: Google colab that contains the data analysis and cleaning process.
Dashboard.twbx : The Tableau Packaged Workbook containing all visualizations and data (this can be opened with Tableau Public).
Dashboard.pdf: A static PDF version of the Tableau dashboard for easy viewing.
Dashboard.png: A high-resolution image of the dashboard.
README.md: This file that provides project details and instructions.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard:
1. Time on Live 360 and Purchases: Users who spend more time on the Live 360 feature are more likely to purchase virtual merchandise. 
2. Fan Challenges and Sponsorship Interactions: There is a positive correlation between the number of fan challenges completed and sponsorship interactions, showing that more engaged users interact more with sponsors.
3. User Clustering: Users were segmented into clusters based on engagement metrics, and high-value clusters were identified based on merchandise purchases and sponsorship interactions.

## Files Description:
Xtern_DA_&_Cleaning.ipynb: Contains the data cleaning steps applied to the dataset before visualization. It includes processes like handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
Dashboard.twbx: Tableau Packaged Workbook that provides interactive visualizations. You can download this file and open it in Tableau Public to explore the interactive dashboard.
Dashboard.pdf: A PDF export of the dashboard, useful for non-interactive viewing.
Dashboard.png: A snapshot image of the dashboard.

## How to Use the Dashboard:
1. For interactive use: 
   - Download the **Dashboard.twbx** file from this repository.
